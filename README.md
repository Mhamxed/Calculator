The Objetive:
- Create a basic calculator using vanilla javascript
- The calculator will not be able to support giant numbers operations, and there will be some
limitations on the dicimal side as well (will not be very acurate)
- The operations supported include:
1/ Addition: adding 2 or mulitple numbers (intergers or dicimal)
2/ Subtraction: the differance between multiple numbers (intergers or dicimal)
3/ Muliplication: multiply multiple numbers between each other ((intergers or dicimal)
4/ Division: divide multiple numbers between each other ((intergers or dicimal)

- You can also delete the last number enetered if you want to edit it
- And a clear button to clear out the screen
